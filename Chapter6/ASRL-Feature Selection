# Required libraries
# Assuming you have libraries for DRL and SSA

# Initialization
N <- 100  # Population size for SSA
Q <- matrix(0, nrow = N, ncol = N)  # Q-function for ASRL agent
alpha_0 <- 0.1  # Initial adaptive learning rate

# State and Action Representation
X <- matrix(runif(N * N), nrow = N)  # Sample dataset
d <- ncol(X)
state <- sample(c(0, 1), d, replace = TRUE)  # Represents a feature subset
action_space <- list()  # All possible feature subsets

# DRL-based Feature Selection
n_episodes <- 100
for(episode in 1:n_episodes) {
  alpha <- alpha_0 / sqrt(episode)
  # Further steps for each episode can be added here
}

# Q-Value Update
gamma <- 0.9  # Discount factor
for(i in 1:length(state)) {
  for(j in 1:length(action_space)) {
    r <- 0  # Reward for the state-action pair (this needs to be defined)
    Q[state[i], action_space[j]] <- Q[state[i], action_space[j]] + alpha * (r + gamma * max(Q[state, ]) - Q[state[i], action_space[j]])
  }
}

# Exploration and Exploitation
epsilon <- 0.1  # Exploration rate
if(runif(1) < epsilon) {
  a_t <- sample(action_space, 1)  # Random action
} else {
  a_t <- which.max(Q[state, ])  # Greedy action
}

# Training
# Update Q-values for multiple episodes (this step needs more details)

# SSA-based Feature Selection
# Objective Function
f <- function(S) {
  # Define the fitness function here
}

# Salp Swarm Update
# Update salp individuals' positions (this step needs more details)

# Fitness Evaluation
# Evaluate fitness of salp individuals (this step needs more details)

# Iteration and Termination
# Iterate SSA algorithm until convergence (this step needs more details)

# Feature Subset Selection
S_start <- numeric(0)
k <- 10  # Number of top features to select
iterations <- 10

for(iter in 1:iterations) {
  S_temp <- DRL_policy(S, k)  # DRL policy function to select top-k features
  S_temp <- SSA(S_temp)  # Refine features using SSA
  S_start <- union(S_start, S_temp)
}

# Final Output
S <- S_start
print(S)
